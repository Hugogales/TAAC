I am currently creating a set of code to be able to train, test and view algorithms train in various enviroments
The code should allow me to easily change specific parameters 

The code should be compatible for parrallel enviroment computation on high-compute system with many gpus and many cpus and should take advangtage of the resources.

I will be testing different algorithms, different enviroment, different hyperparmeters and it should all be easily configureable with minor changes
